                        James Cameron's "Titanic" is an epic, action-packed 
                        romance set against the ill-fated maiden voyage of the R.M.S. 
                        Titanic; the pride and joy of the White Star Line and, at the 
                        time, the largest moving object ever built. She was the most 
                        luxurious liner of her era -- the "ship of dreams" -- which 
                        ultimately carried over 1,500 people to their death in the 
                        ice cold waters of the North Atlantic in the early hours of 
                        April 15, 1912.

                        Disguised as a human, a cyborg assassin known as a Terminator 
                        travels from 2029 to 1984 to kill Sarah Connor. Sent to 
                        protect Sarah is Kyle Reese, who divulges the coming of Skynet, 
                        an artificial intelligence system that will spark a nuclear 
                        holocaust. Sarah is targeted because Skynet knows that her 
                        unborn son will lead the fight against them. With the virtually 
                        unstoppable Terminator in hot pursuit, she and Kyle attempt 
                        to escape.

                        Hiccup is a Norse teenager from the island of Berk, where 
                        fighting dragons are a way of life. His progressive views 
                        and weird sense of humor make him a misfit, despite the fact 
                        that his father is chief of the clan. Tossed into dragon-fighting 
                        school, he endeavors to prove himself as a true Viking. When he 
                        befriends an injured dragon he names Toothless, he has the chance 
                        to plot a new course for his people's future.
